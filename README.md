# Impact of Data Augmentation on Bone Lesions on the Performance of nnU-Net
*AIMI Project Report - ULS23 Challenge - Group 7*


This repository contains the code and documentation for the AIMI Project Report - Universal Lesion Segmentation Challenge (ULS23). The project investigates the impact of applying data augmentations to the bone lesion dataset on the performance of nnU-Net for bone lesion segmentation.

- `augmentation/`: Python scripts for creating augmented bone lesion dataset.
- `scripts/`: Shell scripts for using nnUnet framework on snellius (preprocessing, training, inference, evaluation).
- `images/`: Loss curves.
- `nnUnet_results/`: Logging of training experiments nnUnet framework.
